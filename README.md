A game under development, not really sure where it'll end =)

* Node.js - serverside & game engine ( https://nodejs.org/ )
* The following libraries are used within the engine as well:
  http://victorjs.org/
  http://www.collectionsjs.com/
  https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid

* Pixi.js - clientside rendering ( https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/ )
~~* SockJS - websocket communication ( https://github.com/sockjs )~~~
* ws - websockets in Node.js ( https://github.com/websockets/ws )


Plans
- Drastically reduce data-traffic
- Implement power-ups
