    Rules and settings

    This hairy furball of a mess is where all the speeds, ticks,
    fuels and whatnot are defined.

    This file is used by both the client and the server.

    Status: Have to rewrite to separate speeds and regeneration from
            engine fps and move it to a clock-based approach. Aka, speed
            of player should be unchanged by change in engine fps.
